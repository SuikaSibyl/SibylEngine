# SibylEngine

The Design and Basic Codes are heavily based on The Cherno's Hazel 2D Engine.
Thanks for his great tutorials, which really helps me to learn a lot.

I have done some advanced work already:
- Material System
- 3D Modeling Read-in
- Base-Independent Graphic API ( Support OpenGL & DirectX12 currently)

And I'm planning and actually currently working on some rendering updates:
- Light System
- Computer Shader & post processing stack
- Scriptbale Rendering Pipeline
